                                        ########################## QUESTION ############################

For the following SQL statement, what is wrong with it and how would you fix it:

-- Question:
SELECT UserId, AVG(Total) AS AvgOrderTotal
FROM Invoices
HAVING COUNT(OrderId) >= 1

                                         ############################# SOLUTION ##########################
##SQL CODE

SELECT UserId, AVG(Total) AS AvgOrderTotal
FROM Invoices
GROUP BY  City/Country/Any grouping variable(categorical variable)
HAVING COUNT(OrderId) >= 1

                                         ############################ EXPLANATION ##########################

#For the above SQL statement, a GROUP BY clause is required before HAVING.A column which has repetitive categorical rows which are 
#eligible for grouping like city/country can be grouped accordingly and filtering those shipperIDS with OrderID greater than 1.
#Since OrderId is present, A simple inner join could be done to retrieve grouping variables like shipperID and to identify and 
#answer questions like “How many or list the number of users who have registers more than 10 orders for each country/city/ShipperId ?”.

                                      ####################### ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION ########################
                                            
SELECT Invoices.UserId, AVG(Invoices.Total) AS AvgOrderTotal
FROM (Invoices
FULL JOIN Orders ON Invoices.OrderId = Orders. OrderId)
GROUP BY  ShipperID
HAVING COUNT(OrderId) >= 1

Or

#The invoice data will have customerID which is a primary key in customers data table and could be joined and grouped by 
#city/country and questions such as the number of customers/users having orderID according to each country could be determined.

SELECT Invoices.UserId, AVG(Invoices.Total) AS AvgOrderTotal
FROM (Invoices
FULL JOIN Customer ON Invoices.CustomerId = Customer.CustomerId)
GROUP BY  Country/City
HAVING COUNT(OrderId) >= 1
